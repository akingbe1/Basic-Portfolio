      <p>My name is Benga Akingbe. I currently work as an accountant for a biomass production company named Enviva. I have only been working there for about a year and a half but I have been working in accounting in one way or another for around 10 years. I attented the University of Maryland and graduated with a degree in Public Health. Now you might question how someone who graduated with a Public Health degree became an accountant. Well, it's a long story. You also might question how someone with a Public Health Degree, who works as an accountant wound up in a coding class. I guess you can say I have been searching for my passion. Hopefully, I have finally found it.</p>
